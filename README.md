![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)

## Overview

KitBash3D for Houdini (KB3DfH) is a free an opensource tool bundle to import [KitBash3D](https://kitbash3d.com/) kits into [SideFX Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/), prep the geometry for Solaris, export as BGEO and USD and render in Mantra or Karma.

These tools are currently in BETA and are still being worked on.

## Getting started

To get started with *KB3DfH*, we put down a KB3D Import SOP anywhere on SOP level. We can put it down in a SOP Create LOP if we hchoose to stay inside Solaris.

Once we select the FBX file provided with you KB3D kit, the tool should detect the kit name and process the file accordingly. If the tool does not detect the kit, it's either not a valid kit from KitBash3D, the fbx file has been renamed or the tool has not yet been optimized for that specific kit.

Currently, *KB3DfH* supports six kits for auto-detection:

- Ancient Temples
- Egypt
- Greebles
- Secret Lab
- Storefronts
- Wasteland
